# Report Management System: Project Overview

## Tech Stack Overview
This system leverages your expertise in **React.js**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL** to create a functional and efficient solution for score management.

## Project Structure

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React.js
- **Purpose**: Build a user-friendly interface for:
  - Data entry (e.g., adding and editing scores)
  - Dashboards for visualizing student scores and performance trends.

### Backend
- **Technology**: Express.js and Node.js
- **Purpose**: 
  - Handle API requests for importing/exporting score data.
  - Process and calculate scores.

### Database
- **Technology**: MySQL
- **Purpose**:
  - Store structured data such as student information, scores, and performance reports.

## Key Future Features
1. **Import/Export**: 
   - Use libraries like `xlsx` for handling Excel/CSV files, enabling efficient data uploads and downloads.
2. **Authentication**: 
   - Implement user roles (e.g., admin/teacher) using **JWT** for secure access control.
3. **Reporting**:
   - Generate downloadable **PDF** score summaries with libraries like `pdfkit` or `jspdf`.

This project structure ensures a robust, scalable, and user-focused system aligned with your skillset.


# Requirement for MVP
The most basic and minimum requirements needed to consider the application as functional is as follows: 

- Interface: Having a responsive website would be ideal but it is time consuming so only the PC interface version will be available.

- Login functionality: Security is important and ideally everyone will have login roles and restrictions but for now we will only focus on having a single admin login for the teacher

- All of the Key Future Features will be ignored for the time being
